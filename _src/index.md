I'm Samantha Alaksa, a 19-year-old Interactive Media Development student at Confederation College.

Born and raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario, my upbringing in the country has shaped me into a creative and adaptable person. I’ve had the opportunity to explore various forms of digital expression, which has fueled my passion for web development, UI/UX design, photography, and graphic design. With a broad skill set and a love for learning, I’m excited to continue growing as a multimedia creator and problem-solver.
